                <h1><center>History</center></h1>Durham House of Pets was founded in 1998, by Kevin Calley, when he recognized a demand for

                pet products and services in the local area that had yet to be satisfied. In 

                 the early stages of the business Kevin was the only full time employee of the

                business and primarily was just a grooming service in which you would drop your

                pet off in the morning, and pick it up at the end of the day after he or she had

                been pampered. Over the past 15 years DHP has grown immensely. Kevin now has 15 full

                time employees and has struck deals with some of the biggest brand names in the pet 

                industry to be a retailer of their goods. Today DHP is a one-stop shop when it comes 

                to caring for your pets with everything from food to the latest and greatest toys 

                right in stock. </p>

                <p>

                <h1><center>Why Use Us</center></h1>Our loyal customer base we have built over the years we credit to

                the DHP experience and atmosphere. We take pride in connecting with our client's and 

                 their furry best friends on a personal level. Not only do we remember our client’s 

                 names and many parts of their personal lives but also their pets. We know the pets 

                 favorite treats, what he or she lives for toys while they are waiting to be catered 

                 to and more. Kevin realized many years ago the importance gaining the trust of your 

                 client as they in return are trusting you with their best friend. </p>
